# PowerShell-Toys
A repository with some neat PowerShell toys I've made

## Scripts
| Script Name | Description |
| Security/AzurePasswordSprayer | uses target .csv file with ID and Password columns as input for password spraying with AZ CLI |
| Security/MaliciousCertGen | Generate certificate, uses certutil to decode and execute. Really simple proof-of-concept |
